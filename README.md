# Premier League Soccer Team Analysis Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the project material and related materials for our data mining analysis of a Premier League soccer team's performance. In this project, we aim to utilize data mining techniques to analyze the team's performance and make recommendations for potential player acquisitions to enhance their performance in the league.

## Project Goals
Our main objectives for this project are as follows:
- Identify areas where the team is lacking in performance.
- Determine the team's needs based on data analysis.
- Recommend potential player acquisitions to improve the team's performance in the Premier League.

## Data Sources
We will collect and utilize various data sources related to the team's performance, including, but not limited to:
1. Match statistics (goals scored, conceded, possession, shots on target, etc.).
2. Player statistics (goals, assists, key passes, defensive actions, etc.).
3. Financial data (team budget, player salaries, transfer fees).
4. Injury reports.
5. Previous season performance data.

## Data Mining Methods
Our project will employ the following data mining methods:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the data.
2. Machine Learning algorithms for predictive modeling, player performance evaluation, and team performance prediction.
3. Clustering techniques to group players based on their attributes.
4. Feature selection to identify critical performance indicators.
5. Visualization tools to present results effectively.

## Related Work
Data mining and analytics have become increasingly prevalent in sports, including soccer. Several teams and researchers have applied data mining techniques to evaluate and improve their performance. Our project aims to build upon this body of work by conducting a focused analysis of a specific Premier League team, taking into account their unique challenges, strengths, and goals.

## Evaluation
To evaluate our results, we will simulate a season of the Premier League after the recommended changes have been implemented. This will help us assess whether our recommendations can improve the team's performance and placement in the table, as well as the potential financial benefits our recommendations could bring to the team.

## Milestones
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. EDA and initial insights obtained
3. Machine Learning models developed
4. Player clustering and performance evaluation
5. Look for potential player acquisitions
6. Recommendations formulated
7. Run simulation and check results
8. Final project report and presentation
