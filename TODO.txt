Rough TODO list: 

1. Webscrape the data from transfermarkt that is now manually done in season_analysis
2. Make the graphs better in season_analysis

3. Start with the team_analysis 
    Find the weakneses and where most potential lies in the team

4. Start with player_analysis
    Depending on results from team_analysis, see what players that need to be replaced

5. Start with financial_analysis
    See how much money we can free up by releasing certain players
    See how much we can use for buying new players

6. Start with scouting_analysis
    Find players that have the things missing from the players we are replacing and that we can afford

7. Start with the simulation
    Create a model for simulating a season of PL with the new players that we have
